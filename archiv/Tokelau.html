<p>Neulich erreichte mich folgende eMail aus Tokelau:</p>
<p><code><font color="#0000FF">
Malo ni Martin Strasser, <br><br>

Thank you registering your domain name(s)<br>
with the Dot TK Registry. <br>
<br>
By registering your domain name you are helping<br> 
the people of Tokelau. We would like to inform <br>
you of some importants event that occurred just<br>
this weekend in the islands of Tokelau.<br>
<br>
Cyclone Percy, hit the island group of Tokelau<br>
this weekend. Winds were more then 110km/h,<br>
there was flooding and high seas.<br>
<br>
On Tokelau's Fakaofo atoll, a man was seriously<br>
injured when he was cut by flying debris, two<br>
people had to be rescued after being washed out<br>
to sea and seven houses were washed away.<br>
<br>
Fakaofo does not have a doctor.<br>
<br>
New Zealand's administrator for Tokelau, Neil Walter,<br>
said Cyclone Percy had now passed through the group.<br>
<br>
"For three or four hours you had about a metre of<br>
sea water swirling back and forth between the<br>
ocean on the one hand the lagoon on the other",<br>
he said from Nukunonu, Tokelau's most populated<br>
atoll. "There is damage to the infrastructure - <br>
a lot of areas have been gouged out, the roads<br>
have broken up".<br>
<br>
Despite the fact that the Dot TK team restored<br>
the satellite infrastructure just 10 days ago,<br>
the atolls Nukunonu and Atafu are offline again.<br>
<br>
The cyclone hit the island hard. The power system <br>
is down. Next to that, a lot of damage to buildings<br>
has been done, a lot of equipment is lost, <br>
boats are scattered all over the island along <br>
with debris and building materials.<br>
<br>
Cyclone Percy is one of four tropical cyclones<br>
in the Pacific this month to cause damage,<br>
following Meena, Nancy and Olaf.<br>
<br>
>From our office in Amsterdam, our thoughts are<br> 
with the people on Tokelau. We will do <br>
everything we can to restore Internet communications<br>
on Atafu and Nukunonu as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
With kindest regards,<br><br><br>
